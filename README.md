Explanating the script
===================
## What does the script?

Tidies up the data, extracting just the mean and std
and then doing the average for the several means and std.

## How to use the script?

just run:

source("run_analysis.R")

and then 
(for the result to be stored at an object named set_mean, in example):

set_mean <- merge_data()
